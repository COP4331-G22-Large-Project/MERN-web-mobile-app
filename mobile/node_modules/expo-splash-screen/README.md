# expo-splash-screen

`expo-splash-screen` allows you to customize your app's splash screen, which is the initial screen users see when the app is launched, before it has loaded. Splash screens (sometimes called launch screens) provide a user's first experience with your application.

## üöÄ Features

### Built-in splash screen image resize modes

`expo-splash-screen` contains a built-in feature for taking care of properly displaying your splash screen image. You can use the following resize modes to obtain behavior as if you were using the React Native `<Image>` component's `resizeMode` style.

### `CONTAIN` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both dimensions the width and height of the image will be equal to or less than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

| Android                                                   | iOS                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="./assets/demo-android-contain.gif" height="350" /> | <img src="./assets/demo-ios-contain.gif" height="350" />  |

### `COVER` resize mode

Scale the image uniformly (maintaining the image's aspect ratio) so that both the width and height of the image will be equal to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the device's screen.

| Android                                                   | iOS                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="./assets/demo-android-cover.gif" height="350" /> | <img src="./assets/demo-ios-cover.gif" height="350" />  |

### `NATIVE` resize mode

> **Android only.**

By using this resize mode your app will will leverage Android's ability to present a static bitmap while the application is starting up.
Android (unlike iOS) does not support stretching of the provided image during launch, so the application will present the given image centered on the screen at its original dimensions.

| Android                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| <img src="./assets/demo-android-native.gif" height="350" /> |

> Animation above presents one of our [known issues](#native-mode-pushes-splash-image-up-a-little-bit)

Selecting this resize mode requires some more work to be done in native configuration.
Please take a look at the [`res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`](#resdrawablesplashscreenxml) and [`res/drawable/splashscreen_background.png`](#resdrawablesplashscreen_backgroundpng) sections.

## üìö API

```tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';
```

The native splash screen that is controlled via this module autohides once the ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is mounted. This means that when your app first `render`s view component, the native splash screen will hide. This default behavior can be prevented by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) and later on [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync).

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`

This method makes the native splash screen stay visible until [`SplashScreen.hideAsync()`](#splashscreenhideasync) is called. This must be called before any ReactNative-controlled view hierarchy is rendered (either in the global scope of your main component, or when the component renders `null` at the beginning - see [Examples section](#-examples)).

Preventing default autohiding might come in handy if your application needs to prepare/download some resources and/or make some API calls before first rendering some actual view hierarchy.

### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to `true` when preventing autohiding succeeded and to `false` if the native splash screen is already prevented from autohiding (for instance, if you've already called this method).
`Promise` rejection most likely means that native splash screen cannot be prevented from autohiding (it's already hidden when this method was executed).

### `SplashScreen.hideAsync()`

Hides the native splash screen. Only works if the native splash screen has been previously prevented from autohiding by calling [`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()`](#splashscreenpreventautohideasync) method.

### Returns

A `Promise` that resolves to `true` once the splash screen becomes hidden and to `false` if the splash screen is already hidden.

## üóí Examples

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in global scope

`App.tsx`
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

// Prevent native splash screen from autohiding before App component declaration
SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()
  .then(result => console.log(`SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync() succeeded: ${result}`))
  .catch(console.warn); // it's good to explicitly catch and inspect any error

export default class App extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    // Hides native splash screen after 2s
    setTimeout(async () => {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    }, 2000);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! üëã</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

### `SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync()` in component that initially renders `null`

`App.tsx`
```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

export default class App extends React.Component {
  state = {
    appIsReady: false,
  };

  async componentDidMount() {
    // Prevent native splash screen from autohiding
    try {
      await SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
    } catch (e) {
      console.warn(e);
    }
    this.prepareResources();
  }

  /**
   * Method that serves to load resources and make API calls
   */
  prepareResources = async () => {
    await performAPICalls(...);
    await downloadAssets(...);

    this.setState({ appIsReady: true }, async () => {
      await SplashScreen.hideAsync();
    });
  }

  render() {
    if (!this.state.appIsReady) {
      return null;
    }

    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <Text style={styles.text}>SplashScreen Demo! üëã</Text>
      </View>
    )
  }
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    backgroundColor: '#aabbcc',
  },
  text: {
    color: 'white',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```


## üíª Installation in managed Expo projects

[Managed](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/managed-vs-bare/) Expo projects use the older `SplashScreen` module within the `expo` package (`import { SplashScreen } from 'expo'`).

## üñ• Installation in bare React Native projects

For bare React Native projects, you must ensure that you have [installed and configured the `react-native-unimodules` package](https://github.com/unimodules/react-native-unimodules) before continuing.

## Add the package to your dependencies

```
expo install expo-splash-screen
```

## üì± Configure iOS

Run `npx pod-install` after installing the package.

### Automatic configuration

The easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-splash-screen-command) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.

### Manual Configuration

To achieve native splash screen (in iOS ecosystem it's called `LaunchScreen`) behavior, you have to provide either a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file or a `SplashScreen.xib` file, and configure your Xcode project accordingly.

The guide below shows how to configure your Xcode project to use single image file as a splash screen using a `.storyboard` file (configuration for `.xib` filetype is analogous).

#### `Images.xcassets`

First you need to add the image file that would serve as a splash screen to your native project's resources.

1. In your Xcode project open the `.xcassets` (often named `Images.xcassets` or `Assets.xcassets`) file.
2. In the content panel add `New image set` and name it `SplashScreen`.
3. Provide the splash screen image you've prepared (you have to provide it in three different scales).

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addImagesXcassets.png" height="350" />

#### `SplashScreen.storyboard`

This is the actual splash screen definition and will be used by the system to render your splash screen.

1. Create a `SplashScreen.storyboard` file.
2. Add a `View Controller` to the newly created `.storyboard` file:
    - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),
    - find `View Controller` element,
    - drag-and-drop it to the `.storyboard` file.

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addViewControllerToStoryboard.png" height="350" />

3. Add an `Image View` to the `View Controller`:
    - first remove other `View` element from `View Controller`,
    - open `Library` (`+` button on the top-right),
    - find `Image View` element,
    - drag-and-drop it as a `View Controller` child in view hierarchy inspector.

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addImageViewToStoryboard.png" height="350" />

4. Set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`:
    - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,
    - navigate to `Identity Inspector` in the right panel,
    - and set `Storyboard ID` to `SplashScreenViewController`.

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-addStoryboardID.png" height="350" />

5. Tick `Is Initial View Controller` in `SplashScreenViewController`:
    - select `View Controller` in view hierarchy inspector,
    - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
    - and tick `Is Initial View Controller` in View Controller section.

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-tickIsInitialViewController.png" height="350" />

6. Configure `Image View` source:
    - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
    - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
    - select `SplashScreen` in `Image` parameter).

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-configureImageView.png" height="350" />

7. Configure `Background` of the `Image View`:
    - select `Image View` in view hierarchy inspector,
    - navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel,
    - configure `Background` parameter:
        - To enter a `#RRGGBB` value you need to select `Custom` option and in the `Colors Popup` that appeared you need to navigate to the second tab and choose `RGB Sliders` from dropdown select.

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectBackgroundColor.png" height="350" />

#### `ImageView`'s `ContentMode`

This is how your image will be displayed on the screen.

1. Open `SplashScreen.storyboard` and select `Image View` from `View Controller`.
2. Navigate to `Attributes Inspector` in the right panel and locate `Content Mode`.
3. Select one of the following:
    - `Aspect Fit` to obtain [CONTAIN resize mode](#contain-resize-mode),
    - `Aspect Fill` to obtain [COVER resize mode](#cover-resize-mode).
4. You can always choose other options to achieve different image positioning and scaling.

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectImageViewContentMode.png" height="350" />

#### Launch Screen File

The newly created `SplashScreen.storyboard` needs to be marked as the `Launch Screen File` in your Xcode project in order to be presented from the very beginning of your application launch.

1. Select your project in `Project Navigator`
2. Select your project name from `TARGETS` panel and navigate to `General` tab.
3. Locate `App Icons and Launch Images` section and `Launch Screen File` option.
4. Select or enter `SplashScreen` as the value for located option.

<img src="./assets/configuration-ios-selectLaunchScreen.png" height="350" />

### ü§ñ Configure Android

To achieve fully-native splash screen behavior, `expo-splash-screen` needs to be hooked into the native view hierarchy and consume some resources that have to be placed under `/android/app/src/res` directory.

### Automatic configuration

The easiest way to configure the splash screen in bare React Native projects is with the expo-splash-screen command. See the [README](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/master/packages/expo-splash-screen-command) for more information, or run `yarn expo-splash-screen --help` in your project.

### Manual Configuration

#### `SplashScreen.show(Activity activity, SplashScreenImageResizeMode mode, Class rootViewClass)`

This native method is used to hook `SplashScreen` into the native view hierarchy that is attached to the provided activity.

You can use this method to customize how the splash screen view will be presented. Pass one of `SplashScreenImageResizeMode.{CONTAIN, COVER, NATIVE}` as second argument to do so.

#### `MainActivity.{java,kt}`

Modify `MainActivity.{java,kt}` or any other activity that is marked in the application main `AndroidManifest.xml` as a main activity of your application (main activity is marked with the [`android.intent.action.MAIN`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent#ACTION_MAIN) intent filter. You can take a look at [this example from official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-intro#example)).

Ensure `SplashScreen.show(...)` method is called after `super.onCreate(...)`

```diff
+ import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreen;
+ import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {

  // other methods

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
+   // SplashScreen.show(...) has to be called after super.onCreate(...)
+   SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class);
    ...
  }

  // other methods
}
```

If the `onCreate` method is not yet overridden in your `MainActivity`, override it and include `SplashScreen.show(...)`

```diff
+ import android.os.Bundle;
+ import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreen;
+ import expo.modules.splashscreen.SplashScreenImageResizeMode;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {

+  @Override
+  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
+    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
+   // SplashScreen.show(...) has to be called after super.onCreate(...)
+   SplashScreen.show(this, SplashScreenImageResizeMode.CONTAIN, ReactRootView.class);
    ...
  }

  // other methods
}
```

#### `res/drawable/splashscreen_image.png`

You have to provide your splash screen image and place it under the `res/drawable` directory.
This image will be loaded as soon as Android mounts your application's native view hierarchy.

##### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've selected `SplashScreenImageResizeMode.NATIVE` mode in [`SplashScreen.show`](#splashscreenshowactivity-activity-splashscreenimageresizemode-mode-class-rootviewclass), you need to do a few additional steps.

In your application's `res` directory you might want to have a number of `drawable-X` sub-directories (where `X` is the different DPI for different devices). They store different versions of images that are picked based on the device's DPI (for more information please see [this official Android docs](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities#TaskProvideAltBmp)).

To achieve proper scaling of your splash screen image on every device you should have following directories:
- `res/drawable-mdpi` - scale 1x - resources for medium-density (mdpi) screens (~160dpi). (This is the baseline density.)
- `res/drawable-hdpi` - scale 1.5x - resources for high-density (hdpi) screens (~240dpi).
- `res/drawable-xhdpi` - scale 2x - resources for extra-high-density (xhdpi) screens (~320dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxhdpi` - scale 3x - resources for extra-extra-high-density (xxhdpi) screens (~480dpi).
- `res/drawable-xxxhdpi` - scale 4x - resources for extra-extra-extra-high-density (xxxhdpi) uses (~640dpi).

Each of directories mentioned above should contain the same `splashscreen_image.png` file, but with a different resolution (pay attention to scale factors).


#### `res/values/colors.xml`

This file contains colors that are reused across your application at the native level.
Update the file with the following content or create one if missing:

```diff
<resources>
+ <color name="splashscreen_background">#AABBCC</color> <!-- #AARRGGBB or #RRGGBB format -->
  <!-- Other colors defined for your application -->
</resources>
```


#### `res/drawable/splashscreen.xml`

This file contains the description of how the splash screen view should be drawn by the Android system.
Create the file with the following content:

```diff
+ <layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
+   <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ </layer-list>
```

#### `NATIVE` mode adjustments

If you've selected `SplashScreenImageResizeMode.NATIVE` mode in [`SplashScreen.show`](#splashscreenshowactivity-activity-splashscreenimageresizemode-mode-class-rootviewclass), you should add:

```diff
<layer-list xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
  <item android:drawable="@color/splashscreen_background"/>
+ <item>
+   <bitmap android:gravity="center" android:src="@drawable/splashscreen_image"/>
+ </item>
</layer-list>
```


#### `res/values/styles.xml`

Locate your main activity theme in `/android/app/src/res/values/styles.xml` or create one if missing.

```diff
  <!-- Main activity theme. -->
  <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.Light.NoActionBar">
+   <item name="android:windowBackground">@drawable/splashscreen</item> <!-- this line instructs the system to use 'splashscreen.xml' as a background of the whole application -->
    <!-- Other style properties -->
  </style>
```


#### `AndroidManifest.xml`

Adjust your application's main `AndroidManifest.xml` to contain an `android:theme` property pointing to the style that contains your splash screen configuration:

```diff
<manifest xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    package="com.example.myapp">

  ...

  <application ...>

+   <!-- Ensure that 'android:theme' property is pointing to the style containing native splash screen reference - see 'styles.xml' -->
    <activity
      android:name=".MainActivity"
+     android:theme="@style/AppTheme"
      ...
    >
      ...
    </activity>
  </application>

</manifest>
```

## ‚ùì Known issues

### iOS caching

Splash Screens on iOS apps can sometimes encounter a caching issue where the previous image will flash before showing the new, intended image. When this occurs, we recommend you try power cycling your device and uninstalling and re-installing the application. However, the caching sometimes can persist for a day or two so be patient if the aforementioned steps were unable to resolve the issue.

### `NATIVE` mode pushes splash image up a little bit

See [`NATIVE`](#native-resize-mode) mode preview above.
> We are aware of this issue and unfortunately haven't been able to provide a solution as of yet. This is on our immediate roadmap...
