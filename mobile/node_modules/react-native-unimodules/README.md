# react-native-unimodules

This library contains the core unimodule infrastructure and a collection of unimodules and interfaces that are commonly depended on by other unimodules. You only need to install `react-native-unimodules` once and then you will be able to use [most of the packages from the Expo SDK](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/bare/unimodules-full-list/), like [expo-camera](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/camera/), [expo-media-library](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/media-library/) and many more, [in any React Native project](https://blog.expo.io/you-can-now-use-expo-apis-in-any-react-native-app-7c3a93041331).

The easiest way to use the library is to initialize a project with it already installed: `npx create-react-native-app my-app`.

> You can also use `expo-cli` to do this - run `npm i -g expo-cli` and then `expo init --template bare-minimum` or `expo init --template expo-template-bare-typescript` if you prefer TypeScript.

If you have an existing project you'd like to install it into, please read the following instructions.

## üì¶ Installation

**This project requires that you use CocoaPods on iOS**, to set it up see [this gist](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/b0ea11a36dc423e441b7d36e36eb5a26), or relevant parts of the [this guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps#3-install-cocoapods). React Native >= 0.60 ships with Cocoapods support by default, so this should be easy if you're already on that version.

```bash
npm install react-native-unimodules
```

Now you need to configure the library for iOS and/or Android.

## üçé Configure iOS

- Open `ios/Podfile` in your editor and make it look [like this one on react-native <= 0.59](https://gist.github.com/sjchmiela/6c079f2173938a9a61a7c6f053c45000) or [like this one on react-native >= 0.60](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/d093e440698404803bd9c29d962949b0/revisions#diff-4a25b996826623c4a3a4910f47f10c30).
- Run `pod install` again
- Update your `AppDelegate.h` and `AppDelegate.m` according to [to look like these](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/1ece8c32a3c5c9d0ac3a470460c65603).
  - If you use [`react-native-navigation`](https://github.com/wix/react-native-navigation), you will need to use its `bridgeManagerDelegate` option [like in this gist](https://gist.github.com/brentvatne/67909ec442121de22c9b81c629a99aa6).

### Advanced configuration

<details><summary>Need to customize node_modules path?</summary>
<p>

If you need to customize the path to node_modules, for example because you are using yarn workspaces, then you can pass in a param for this: `use_unimodules!(modules_paths: ['./path/to/node_modules'])`

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Need to exclude some unimodules that are being automatically linked?</summary> 
<p>

If you need to exclude some of the unimodules that you are not using but they got installed by your other dependencies (like `expo`), then you can pass in `exclude` param for this. For example, if you want to exclude `expo-face-detector`, you may want to use this: `use_unimodules!(exclude: ['expo-face-detector'])`

</p>
</details>

## ü§ñ Configure Android

**In `android/settings.gradle`**

1. At the top add `apply from: '../node_modules/react-native-unimodules/gradle.groovy'`
1. Then call `includeUnimodulesProjects()` on the next line.

**In `android/app/build.gradle`**

1. Add `apply from: '../../node_modules/react-native-unimodules/gradle.groovy'` anywhere before the `dependencies {}` block.
1. Add `addUnimodulesDependencies()` inside `dependencies {}` block.
1. We recommend you use Java 1.8, you can set this [like this](https://github.com/expo/expo/commit/e175f870418fc69e8c129168118264439d73d7cc).

**In `android/build.gradle`**

1. Update `minSdkVersion` to `21`.

**In `MainApplication.java`**
Make the changes outlined in the diff that correspondes to your react-native version.

### Advanced configuration

<details><summary>Need to customize node_modules path?</summary>
<p>

If you need to customize the path to node_modules, for example because you are using yarn workspaces, then you can pass in a param `modulesPaths` for both of these functions: `includeUnimodulesProjects([modulesPaths: ['./path/to/node_modules']])`, `addUnimodulesDependencies([modulesPaths: ['./path/to/node_modules']])`

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Need to exclude some unimodules that are being automatically linked?</summary>
<p>

If you need to exclude some of the unimodules that you are not using but they got installed by your other dependencies (like `expo`), then you can pass in `exclude` param for this. For example, if you want to exclude `expo-face-detector`, you may want to use this: `addUnimodulesDependencies([exclude: ['expo-face-detector']])`

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Need to customize configuration of unimodule dependencies?</summary>
<p>

You can also customize the configuration of the unimodules dependencies (the default is `implementation`, if you're using Gradle older than 3.0, you will need to set `configuration: "compile"` in `addUnimodulesDependencies`, like: `addUnimodulesDependencies([configuration: "compile"])`)

</p>

# API

It's possible that you will not have to use any of the code provided by this package directly, it may be used only by other Unimodules that you install.

But it's likely that you will want to use something like FileSystem or Permissions, and to do that you can import the following modules like so:

```js
import { Asset, Constants, FileSystem, Permissions } from 'react-native-unimodules';
```

You can import them directly from the specific Unimodule package if you like, but your linter may complain about importing a transitive dependency.

```js
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
```
